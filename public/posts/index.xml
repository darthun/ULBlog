      <description>To make a Boxing Gym When I first started this project, I wanted to keep it a surprise. Half the cool points of making a &amp;ldquo;so-bad-it&amp;rsquo;s-good&amp;rdquo; video game would come from the shock value. Once people have expectations, it&amp;rsquo;s harder to impress them. It&amp;rsquo;s like trying to make a follow-up to a viral De Niro meme video !
Anyway, to make a boxing game, you need a ring. And that ring needs a gym.</description>

      <description>The Problem Replicating someone&amp;rsquo;s likeness in a video game is like trying to paint the Mona Lisa with a paint-by-numbers kitâ€”except the paint is in invisible ink. Professional game studios have entire armies of artists to design the hair, the clothes, and everything in between.
I, on the other hand, have a budget that could be comfortably described as &amp;ldquo;nonexistent&amp;rdquo; and skills that are &amp;ldquo;developing.&amp;rdquo; So, I need a shortcut to get realistic models into the game without turning into a hermit for months to learn new software.</description>
